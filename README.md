# Hello, my gorgeous friends
I'm a self-taught front-end web developer who is ready to learn more about web dev. I'm 15 and passionate about diving deeper into this industry of programming despite of my age.
I've never bought any course, any mentorship, all I learned was by watching Youtube videos, by help of my best friend - Stackoverflow and reading different internet posts. 
I'm really serious about becoming front-end web dev. Also I started creating web projects with people all over the world from the Discord.
Recently I started working on a really cool project. PS: that is a really cool and big project for everyone. If you are interested on building this cool project with me, then just text me,
I will text you back. But it can also take me a while to respond to your message. The reason could be that I live on the region where "GMT+4" is my time zone.
That's like 8 hours after Eastern time.
